This model for Fashion-MNIST clothing classification is built using computer vision and deep learning.
The dataset comprised of 60,000 small square 28Ã—28 pixel grayscale images of items of 10 types of clothing, such as shoes, t-shirts, dresses, and more.
Developed a robust evaluation on a model and established a baseline of performance for the task.
And finalized model by evaluating the performance by improving regularizations to baseline model,tuning model depth and by tuning learning rate.
